              <p>
                During my internship at
                <a href="https://www.nwsdigital.com/">Northwoods</a> I
                collaborated with a back-end developer to create V1 of a new
                video checkpointing tool for
                <a href="https://titancms.com/">Titan CMS</a>. Throughout
                development of the app, a primary focus was on avoiding breaking
                changes in Titan. The goal was to ensure that the the app could
                be easily deployed as part of other sites using Titan CMS. For
                this project I primarily used CSS and JavaScript, with minimal
                changes to HTML/XSL/Titan. I also worked solo and in tandem with
                the back-end dev to test the app on a variety of browsers and in
                a variety of scenarios. The application is now in regular use
                in-house at Northwoods and will eventually be released for use
                by Titan clients. This is a fully functional CRUD app and is
                responsive and accessible across devices.
              </p>
              <p>
                This project included three primary components: a data editor
                (add/edit video), data detail (watch video), data list (video
                library) page. I developed the front end for all three and used
                JavaScript to create additional functionality on the watch and
                add/edit pages for better UI/UX.

              <h3>Key Features & Challenges</h3>
              <h4>Accessible Modal Forms</h4>
              <p>
                The modal forms provide core functionality for the checkpointing
                tool and are used to add, edit, and delete checkpoint
                information on the page for any number of checkpoints.
                Generating the forms as modal dialogs required extensive work in
                JavaScript since the forms are such a key part of the
                application and tied to various functions. Due to constraints
                posed by creating this within the CMS, all customization had to
                be done on the front-end. Furthermore, I wanted to ensure that
                the modals were fully accessible to WCAG standards. This meant
                implementing features such as initial/returning focus, keyboard
                support and traps, appropriate markup, hiding background window
                content, etc. I was able to implement the modal form dialogs in
                a way that itegrated with the exisiting code and did not disrupt
                the tool's functionality.
              </p>

              <h4>Two-Way Timestamp Conversions</h4>
              <p>
                The timestamp functionality was also challenging, but was a
                feature that I proposed and built to improve the user
                experience. The video checkpointing tool uses time in seconds to
                create/read/update/delete data as the user makes changes on the
                page; therefore, the tool needs to save and read time in that
                integer format. However, on longer videos timestamps in seconds
                can become unwieldy for the user. I created javascript functions
                that handle two-way time conversions in order to provide the
                needed info to the tool while displaying a more readable format
                to the user. Every time that the user sees a timestamp in a
                modal form or in the video module, it is shown converted to a
                string of M:SS, MM:SS, or H:MM:SS (I removed leading zeros with
                a RegEx). However all page functionality for the editor still
                works with time in seconds, and data is converted back and forth
                as needed for application processes such as checkpoint updates.
                I implemented my conversion functions and integrated them with
                the existing JavaScript code to run at the appropriate times.

              </div>
              <h3>Key Features & Challenges</h3>
              <h4>Visual Scrolling</h4>
              <p>
                Visual scrolling moves the active checkpoint into view as a
                video is played. This was a UI/UX improvement that needed to be
                seamlessly integrated with other functionality in order to work
                as intended.
              </p>
              <h4>Copy Buttons & "Toasts"</h4>
              <p>
                The design called for minimal copy buttons; however, I was able
                to increase the info conveyed by expanding the copy buttons on
                hover and providing a "toast" when a checkpoint is copied. The
                challenge here was creating these elements in a visually
                cohesive way while containing the functionality to the video
                checkpointing module and working within Titan CMS framework.

              <h3>Key Features & Challenges</h3>
              <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
              <p>
                The Video Library page design was kept simple since we expected
                further changes once it was integrated into a site. However, in
                working on this page, the back-end dev and I discovered the
                source of a bug that I had noted in the Editor. I noticed that
                certain info didn't update when edited, which then caused issues
                with the page data not saving properly. While cross checking the
                Editor page with the Video Library, we realized that it was a
                small mismatch in our data configuration. We worked together to
                determine the best fix for the issue, updated our respective
                code to work in tandem, and then retested to confirm that the
                bug was resolved. Throughout the development process we found
                pair programming very valuable as a way to more quickly problem
                solve. After all, two heads are better than one!
